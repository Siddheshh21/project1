## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

The Employee Salary Prediction Project is designed to develop a robust machine learning model that estimates the expected salary of an employee based on multiple factors such as years of experience, education qualification, job title, industry, and geographic location. In a fast-evolving job market, organizations often struggle to offer competitive and fair compensation due to inconsistent benchmarks or subjective estimations. This project addresses that challenge by using data-driven insights to predict salaries with high accuracy.

The model is trained using historical employee salary datasets and applies supervised learning techniques, primarily regression algorithms. Various models such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost are tested and evaluated to select the most accurate and reliable one.

The project also includes extensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis to uncover key trends and correlations within the dataset. Visualization libraries like Seaborn and Matplotlib are used to present salary trends across different roles, industries, and experience levels.

In addition to the backend machine learning workflow, the project may be extended with a web-based user interface using Flask or Streamlit. This allows HR teams or recruiters to input details of a candidate or position and instantly receive a salary prediction, making the model practically usable in real-world hiring scenarios.

Overall, the goal of the project is not only to predict salaries but also to promote transparency and consistency in employee compensation decisions.
